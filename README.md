# Car Price Predictor
It is a machine learning based project which helps to predict the price of the car on the basis of input features given by the user.
The algorithm used to predict the price is Random Forest algorithm.
The dataset has been taken from Kaggle website.
The features used to predict the price of the car are-
- No of kilometers travelled
- No of years driven
- No of previous owners
- fuel type
- Transmission Type
- Seller type

The application is developed using Python's Flask framework.
